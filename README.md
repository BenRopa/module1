# <**Refactoring to Revitalize**>

## Description

In this project we practiced refactoring HTML/CSS code to use best practices and increase accesibility. We completed this through the use of computational thinking, HTML, CSS, and git. I was able to gain a more concrete idea of what HTML semantic elements are and how the code of our webpages should be displayed. Previously, our existing webpage did not meet accessibilty standards. We provided these features in order to better the webpage and user experience.
